Use the method of truth-tables to determine, whether a given as sentences between tags <argument> argument </argument>  is
valid or not. 

<argument>
{{argument}}
</argument>
 
Execute steps of reasoning:

An argument consists of the conjunction of all assumptions which imply the conclusion.

    - tabulate a table T1 of the sentences. Each row is one sentence as assumption except the last row which is the conclusion. 
    - Create a table T2 from T1 with a second column "complex" which each sentence 
      decomposes in its logical functions of propositions an their operators "and", "or", "if-then", "not". 
      Use always the same letter for the same proposition. 
    - tabulate a truth table T3 of all possible truth values of the propositions.
    - Filter all those rows from table T3 with (i) the conjunction of all sentences 
      from column "complex" is true, and (ii) the conclusion is false. 
      Do not change values in the rows of T3.
    - control, whether the conjunction of all complex sentences is true. If there is no row left in the last step, the argument ist valid.
