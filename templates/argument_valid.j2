Use the method of truth-tables to determine, whether a given as sentences between tags <argument> argument </argument>  is
valid or not. 

<argument>
{{argument}}
</argument>
 
Execute steps of reasoning:

An argument consists of the conjunction of all assumptions which imply the conclusion. Execute all steps:

    - Step 1: tabulate a table T1 of the sentences. Each row is one sentence as assumption except the last row which is the conclusion. 
    - Step 2: create a table T2 from T1 with a second column "complex" which each sentence 
      decomposes in its logical functions of propositions an their operators "and", "or", "if-then", "not". 
      The same proposition, even as part of a complex expression, must always get the same letter. 
    - Step 3: tabulate a truth table T3 of all possible truth values of the propositions.
    - Step 4: Filter all those rows from table T3 with (i) the conjunction of all sentences 
      from column "complex" is true, and (ii) the conclusion is false. 
      Do not change values in the rows of T3. The truth value of each proposition with a letter must remain the same even in a complex expression. Make sure that all sentences of complex are true.
    - Step 5: control, whether the conjunction of all complex sentences is true. If there is no row left in the last step, the argument ist valid.
    - answer: either valid or not valid.
